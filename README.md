# OpenEpiOpi
A collection of open and publicly sourced data for studying the social determinants of the opioid epidemic

## About
The goal of this study is to collect, clean, and centralize a large body of data regarding social determinants and adverse outcomes related to the US opioid epidemic. Addiction is a complicated problem, one our society has faced in many times recent memory with limited success and few, shining examples of working intervention programs. The idea of a miracle cure, that one mind with the right skills and perspectives might suddenly turn things around where others have failed is unlikely at best. Therefore we look to centralize as much data as possible, facilitating community efforts to attack this problem from as many angles as possible.

This effort is directly inspired by Caitlin Rivers 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic data repo (https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola) and the CDC 2016 Zika epidemic data repos (https://github.com/cdcepi/zika)


## Target Data
In this repository we seek to explore the following data types:
* Sociodemographic factors- economic and societal attributes with the potential to affect the course of opioid addiction within a community. Examples include unemployment, income, education, social mobility, etc.
* Addiction Outcomes- negative societal outcomes relating to opioid use. While this should primarily focus on opioid related morbidity, mortality, and pathogens transmitted by intravenous drug use, other events such as child abuse may be considered. For many outcomes and sociodemographic factors there may likely be strong reciprocal relationships, some of which may offer interesting candidates for study. Therefore, the dividing line should be whether the event could likely have arisen in the absence of opioid usage.
* Events- point events or resources with the potential to suddenly change the impact of sociodemographi factors on addiction outcomes. These may be needle clinics, employment centers, physical therapists, pain clinics, etc. Events should be selected based on their ability to inform future policy and intervetions. As events will generally represent points in place and time, code will be needed to aggregate them to county level via population mean travel times.

Initial data collection efforts will focus on monthly/ yearly county level data for the state of Virginia from 2000 to present, though further work may expand this geographic reach.
